# LangGraph Multi-Agent — JD Intake Pipeline

A companion repo to [Ai_Agent_new](https://github.com/alumnx-ai-labs/Ai_Agent_new), teaching **LangGraph** instead of LangChain's `create_agent()`.

**Important framing:** despite the repo name, this example is not "agents talking to agents." Every node here is a deterministic step — some plain Python (duplicate check, routing rules), some a single LLM call for one specific job (extraction, scoring, rewriting). None of them reason over their own tools in a loop the way Day 1's agent did. The lesson is **LangGraph as a workflow engine**: explicit typed state, conditional branching, bounded retry loops, and a human-in-the-loop pause — not multi-agent orchestration.

## The Use Case

Recruiters submit messy job descriptions (JDs) — incomplete, duplicate, vague, or biased. Rather than let a raw JD hit the database unchecked, this pipeline cleans, scores, deduplicates, and only then publishes it — asking a human for help when it can't proceed alone.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alumnx-ai-labs/LangGraph_Multi_Agent.git
cd LangGraph_Multi_Agent
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
# source myenv/bin/activate # macOS/Linux
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Get a free Gemini API key
[aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) — sign in, **Create API key**.

### 5. Get a free MongoDB Atlas cluster
Same as `Ai_Agent_new` — see that repo's README for the full walkthrough (sign up, free M0 cluster, database user, IP allowlist, connection string). This pipeline uses a different database name (`jd_intake_db`), so it won't collide with Day 1's data even on the same cluster.

### 6. Set up `.env`
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Fill in:
```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://your_username:your_password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/
```

## Usage

Submit a JD:
```bash
python jd_intake_pipeline.py "Senior Backend Engineer at Acme, Bangalore, 5+ years, hybrid. Building our core platform APIs."
```

If required fields are missing, the pipeline asks for them **one at a time** and exits after each question, rather than blocking on input or asking for everything at once:
```
[thread_id: 8f2a...]

[PAUSED] What is the location?
Resume with: python jd_intake_pipeline.py --resume <thread_id> "<your answer>"
```

Resume it — in the same terminal, a new terminal, or after restarting your machine — with:
```bash
python jd_intake_pipeline.py --resume 8f2a... "Bangalore"
```
If another field is still missing, it'll pause again asking for the next one. Once every required field has an answer, it proceeds straight to duplicate checking (no re-parsing needed, since each answer is taken verbatim).

This is deliberately **two separate process invocations**, not one interactive loop. The pipeline's state is persisted to `checkpoints.sqlite` (via LangGraph's `SqliteSaver`) keyed by `thread_id` — that's what makes it possible to genuinely kill the process and resume later. An in-process `while` loop calling `input()` would look similar but wouldn't prove persistence actually works.

## State

```python
class JDState(TypedDict):
    raw_jd: str
    parsed: dict                # title, company, location, exp, work_mode
    missing_fields: list
    missing_info_attempts: int
    quality_score: int
    quality_feedback: str
    rewritten_jd: str
    revision_count: int
    duplicate_of: Optional[str]
    status: str                 # published | rejected | needs_input
    job_id: Optional[str]
    log: list                   # audit trail of what each node did
```

## Nodes

| Node | Does |
|---|---|
| `parse_jd` | LLM structured extraction → `parsed`, flags `missing_fields` |
| `request_missing_info` | `interrupt()` — pauses, asks a human for one missing field, sets it directly in `parsed` |
| `check_duplicate` | Plain DB lookup (exact match on lowercased title+company) → sets `duplicate_of` |
| `score_quality` | LLM scores clarity, specificity, bias-free language → `quality_score` + feedback |
| `rewrite_jd` | Rewrites using the feedback → `rewritten_jd`, increments `revision_count` |
| `publish_job` | Writes to MongoDB → `job_id`, status `published` |
| `reject` | Terminal: duplicate found |
| `escalate` | Terminal: missing-info or quality-revision attempts exhausted, status `needs_input` |

## Edges

```
START → parse_jd
parse_jd  ──[fields missing]──→ request_missing_info (asks ONE field)
          └─[complete]────────→ check_duplicate

request_missing_info ──[fields still missing, attempts < 6]──→ request_missing_info   # ask next field
                      ├─[fields still missing, attempts ≥ 6]──→ escalate
                      └─[all fields collected]─────────────────→ check_duplicate

check_duplicate ──[duplicate]──→ reject
                └─[unique]─────→ score_quality

score_quality ──[score ≥ 75]────────────────────→ publish_job
              ├─[score < 75, revisions < 2]─────→ rewrite_jd → score_quality   # self-improvement loop
              └─[score < 75, revisions ≥ 2]─────→ escalate

publish_job → END      reject → END      escalate → END
```

Two things worth noticing: **the duplicate check and both retry caps are plain Python conditionals, not LLM decisions** — a duplicate is a fact, not a judgment call, and a circuit breaker you can't trust an LLM to enforce on itself isn't a circuit breaker. And **both loops (missing-info, quality-rewrite) land on the same `escalate` node** when they run out — this pipeline never auto-rejects a JD just because it couldn't get it polished or complete in time; it hands off to a human instead.

## Design decisions worth knowing

- **MongoDB, not a second database.** The duplicate check is a simple two-field lookup with no joins — doesn't need anything relational, and reuses the Atlas account already set up for Day 1.
- **Exact-match lowercase fields, not regex.** Day 1's job search tool crashed when an unescaped keyword hit MongoDB's `$regex`. `jobs_db.py` here compares precomputed `title_lower`/`company_lower` fields instead — safer and faster.
- **`SqliteSaver`, not `MemorySaver`.** Only a persistent checkpointer survives a process restart, which is the whole point of the pause/resume demo.
- **`escalate` is shared** by both the missing-info cap and the quality-revision cap, rather than two separate "give up" nodes — same outcome (hand off to a human), one node.
- **Missing fields are asked one at a time, not all at once.** Each answer is taken verbatim and written directly into `parsed` — no re-parsing, no loop back through `parse_jd`. Simpler, fewer LLM calls, and it reads like a normal short Q&A instead of one dense "please provide: X, Y, Z" prompt.

## Troubleshooting

### MongoDB `ServerSelectionTimeoutError` / SSL handshake failures
Almost always a missing IP allowlist entry, not a connectivity bug — Atlas rejects the TLS handshake for non-allowlisted IPs with an error that looks like a generic SSL failure. Check **Network Access** in Atlas and add your current IP.

### Garbled characters (mojibake) in output
Fixed via `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8")` at the top of `jd_intake_pipeline.py` — Gemini's replies can contain accented characters, and Windows consoles don't default to UTF-8 stdout.

### "No GOOGLE_API_KEY found" / "MONGO_URI environment variable is not set"
See `Ai_Agent_new`'s README troubleshooting section — same causes, same fixes.
